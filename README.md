# stop-dismount
A simple Tera Proxy module to stop you from immediately dismounting because of SP's retries

Mostly only happens during high cooldown buffs, like Ultra Hyper-Turbo Fire (UHTF) times, where the retries will cause you to dismount straightaway. Increase timeout in Index.js if it does not work well.
